    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Select the beans, discarding any that are broken or have imperfections. Wash them thoroughly under cold running water and then let them soak for at least 12 hours in a container with plenty of water so they can absorb it and hydrate. In another container, place the cured ham to desalinate it.</li>
      <li>Step 2: The next day, discard the soaking water from the beans and the cured ham. Prepare a pot with the beans and cover them with water until it reaches about two fingers above the legumes. If possible, use mineral water to avoid the variability of lime content in tap water, which may affect the final result. Place the pot on the stove and bring it to a boil.</li>
      <li>Step 3:It is recommended to rinse the cured meats with hot water to remove some of the fat before adding them to the dish. Once rinsed, add them to the pot along with the cured ham and a peeled onion cut in half. Lower the heat. Skim the foam from the surface of the broth and let it simmer for approximately two hours. Continue skimming the foam and excess fat from the meats throughout the cooking process. Only a skimmer should touch the fabada, and it should not go beyond the surface. To ensure the beans don’t break, avoid stirring with a spoon; gently shake the pot instead.</li>
      <li>Step 4:Midway through the cooking process, lightly toast the saffron (usually done by placing it on the hot lid of the pot for a minute), dissolve it in half a glass of cooking broth, and add it to the pot.</li>
      <li>Step 5: On a couple of occasions, add a glass of cold water to the stew to create a temperature contrast that helps prevent the legumes from breaking. This process is known as "scaring" the beans</li>
      <li>Step 6: When the beans are tender, adjust the salt, remove the pot from the heat, and let it rest covered for at least one hour, preferably two, or even better, reserve it to be eaten the next day (the longer it rests, the better the flavors develop). When serving, remove and discard the onion, separate the meat from the legumes and broth, and present the latter in a soup tureen with the meat chopped and placed on a separate platter so each diner can assemble their dish as desired.
